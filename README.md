Image processing based body measuring system

To develop a system for getting precise body measurements of customers in textile industries by using cameras.


Taking body measurements and sizes by hand is laborious and time-consuming. It is
also inexact and requires close contact which is not possible during this COVID-19
situation. With our body measuring scanner, you can measure textile customerâ€™s body
measurements using only the device without any physical contact with the customer
and receive the measurements in a matter of seconds. The whole body is scanned
in one scan, with all relevant body measurements taken. Precise body measurements
ensure that clothes are more comfortable to wear and so customers are more satisfied. Online shopping platforms have been attracting many customers since they
were introduced in the last decade of the 20th century.Using our body measuring system, customers can purchase any merchandise in-store at anytime without the need
to physically wearing dress materials or wait in lines for trying dresses in the trial
rooms. Thus we can avoid trial rooms which is used by many people necessarily or
unwanted. And also reduce the effect of wearing dress materials for trying there by
making each clothes fresh without any damages. Despite their advantages in comparison with in-store shopping, customers often have concerns when they shop for products that require measurements estimation for clothes. Choosing the wrong clothing
size, in particular, is a common issue experienced by many people. Therefore, in
this research, we proposed a model that estimates human body measurements from
human real-time pictures using open pose models and caffee models.
